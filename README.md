# hello-world
you need to start with something, so here it is
  Hi. My name is Dmitri. I started my journey as a programmer at College of Technology and Economy. There I begin with programing language called Basic. At that time I didn't know what programming is at all, so working with it helped me a lot. I created my first Hello World project, learned about a syntax, variable types, branches and cycles.  Then there was Pascal. We started to work on graphics, but in general we still worked with a console. It was a relief when we finally switched to C++ because it was the first language that was relevant then. At that time my groupmate discovered an IDE called codeblocks. There was like everything you could imagine. After that we switched to Visual C++, and finally we got to java. There was also a bit of PHP, and of course a course in Photoshop. At that time I wasn't really sure if I want to be a programer. I was looking more toward filmmaking actually. 
  My hobby at that time was a project called MATS (Machinima Amateur Translation Squad). We were doing a voiceover for videos from youtube. The main theme of that videos was gaming. There I practiced my English knowledge by translating almost all of the content that we posted. 
  After I graduated from college I decided to go to university
